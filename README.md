**Overview:**

The goal is to make a 2D physics engine and level editor in python, using pygame and pymunk, and rendering through openGL to enable shader capabilities.
The engine will also include robust support for procedural animation and creature creation, as seen in the popular survival video game Rain World.

**How to use:**

Make sure all dependencies are installed from the requirements.txt file.
Run main.py.
The mouse ball will interact with the physics environment. 
Hold space and use the arrow keys to move the ball manually.
Press the '1' key to bring up the shader settings menu.
